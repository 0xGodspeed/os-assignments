## Create Result Directory if Not Exists:
The script first creates a directory named "Result" if it doesn't already exist using the mkdir -p Result command.

## Create and Clear Output File:

It then creates an empty file named "output.txt" inside the "Result" directory using the touch Result/output.txt command.
The > operator is used to clear the contents of the output file in case it already exists, ensuring a fresh start.

## Loop through Input File:

The script enters a loop that reads the contents of the "input.txt" file line by line. Each line contains two numbers (x and y) and an operation.

## Read and Process Inputs:

For each line, the script splits the line into three parts: x, y, and operation. These are assigned to variables using the read -r x y operation command.

## Perform the Chosen Operation:

Inside the loop, there's a case statement that checks the value of the "operation" variable.
If the operation is "xor," the script calculates the bitwise XOR of x and y using result=$((x ^ y)).
If the operation is "product," the script calculates the product of x and y using result=$((x * y)).
If the operation is "compare," the script compares x and y and assigns the larger value to the result variable using a ternary operator.

## Write Result to Output File:

After calculating the result based on the operation, the script constructs a line that indicates the operation performed and the calculated result, e.g., "x y operation = result".
This line is appended to the "output.txt" file inside the "Result" directory using echo "$x $y $operation = $result" >> Result/output.txt.

## Repeat for Each Input Set:
The loop continues to read the next line from the "input.txt" file and performs the same steps until all input sets have been processed.
